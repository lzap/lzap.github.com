<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
Just few years before I used to sping records in clubs, halls and festivals. I started with techno in ten years ago, then bought bunch of drum and bass plates, to collect house records just few years later.<br /><br />These days I only play on my friends parties over the summer. It's relaxing and fun. And the time is finally here again. I am going to remove the dust from my turntables, records, headphones and other equipment now. This year I will be also introducing Stanton SC System 3 with open-source mixing software Mixxx running on Fedora 15. So four decks this year - two turntables and two fedoras :-)<br /><br />Here is a small review of my old sets that have been recorded somewhere between 2004 and 2008. It's on-line for years. My post is just a reminder.<br /><br />Let me start with <b>drum and bass</b>. I put lot of dnb sets on-line:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/2010/04/its-my-space-winter-2008.html">Atmosferic deep set</a></li><li><a href="http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/2010/04/blue-underground-winter-2007.html">Deep bubbling one</a></li><li><a href="http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/2010/04/hlubocky-dnb-spring-2006.html">Old-school underground</a></li><li><a href="http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/2010/04/liquidz-spring-2007.html">Liquid funk from London and Brazil</a></li><li><a href="http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/2010/04/braz-liquidz-spring-2007.html">Two liquid-funk sets</a></li><li><a href="http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/2010/04/liquid-nations-1-spring-2008.html">Liquid-funk feat.

I used to play it a lot, but I only have <a href="http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/2010/04/cafe-del-jamendo-fall-2007.html">one older</a> set online. But the good news is there are some tracks from free Jamendo.com site mixed in using my CD player. The set is smooth, easy listening.<br /><br />Do you like <b>techno</b>? Well there's <a href="http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/2010/04/techno-vs-schranz-spring-2006.html">one schranz set</a> on-line, it's a bit harder. Not so bad.<br /><br />Wan't me to play on your party? Just call me. I am fuelled by beer. I prefer Litovel or Svijany, but you definitely won't insult me with Pilsner Urquell ;-)
