================

I know this has nothing to do with Linux, Fedora, Red Hat of Foreman, my
typical topics on this blog, but my kid is looking for playing Minecraft on our
PS4 with his XBox/Android/iOS friends and cross-play capability of Bedrock
edition which is expected to appear on Playstation should do it.

I've spotted product number (PN) **PS719344100** and barcode (EAN) number
**711719344100** with item entitled "**Minecraft Bedrock PS4**" across many
e-shops across Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary as well as
[alza.co.uk](https://alza.co.uk) (Czech company operating in UK). Release dates
varies, all of the shops have shipping date set to either December 3rd (alza
sites, changed to 6th) or between **December 6th** and **December 12th**.

Some e-shops say it's boxed version, some it's electronic license. Some e-shops
did put old (PS4) version cover, some used blank placeholder and there are few
which made edits to XBox version cover adding PS4 logo on top of it.
Speculation: they were not given official cover or graphics, but someone
probably received "go" from the publisher for that region. They all know that
many people are waiting for this and the race for preorders has started there.

I was able to complete preorders both on [Alza.cz](https://Alza.cz) and
[JRC.cz](https://JRC.cz). Let's see. The release date on both e-shops was set
to December 3rd, Playstation 25th birdthday, but it was changedboth. I can
confirm that those four-five Czech e-shops from the list are legit, I've used
all of them multiple times and I use [Alza.cz](https://alza.cz) regularly. Also
JRC and XZone are gaming shops similar to "Gamestop" so that's a sign that
something is showing up. Speculation: Maybe not on 3rd of December, but
probably it's happening.

but it was removed, it has been featured on
[ECKOSOLDIER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWkhptIPSRM) youtube channel, at
[McBedrock.com](https://www.mcbedrock.com/2019/12/02/minecraft-playstation-4-bedrock-pre-order-leaked/)
site and multiple YT channels and articles actually. I have to say I've
stumbled upon the [alza.cz](https://alza.cz) offer myself when I was browsing
its PS4 sales but I need to admit I've found at least [one other
source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avo36WScr0A&feature=youtu.be) that
noticed a day before (on Sunday) after I created this post. So I was not
definitely the first who saw this, I just realized there is a PN/EAN and
googled it a bit more.

Also Google AdSense campaign for Target.com [has been
spotted](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSMinecraft/comments/e6q6lg/i_just_found_that_when_i_searched_minecraft/)
too. Link is not (yet?) valid tho. Anyone can create such a campaign, but it
costs money, it's indeed interesting.

More speculation ahead: I think the this December (early or mid) is a good
release date as Microsoft don't want to jeopardize XBox Christmas sales so they
have scheduled it after Black Friday and after Christmas PS4 bundles
announcement. Yet they want to have the title released before Christmas because
this is going to be a hit for sure. Or maybe it's coming for marketing reasons
after Christmas in early 2020 and somebody got the info in advance. Only time
shows.
