<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
As a ThinkPad X201 user, I was more than happy to check out new X220 model. At the first sitght it is still ThinkPad X-series. Similar size, feeling, quality. I am comparing my good-old X201 with this model 287-2SG.<br /><br /><b>Pros</b><br /><br /><ul><li>The lid has no lock. Frankly, I found it annoying and didnt like it ever on all my ThinkPads.</li><li>Thank God the keyboard layout is standard with only few changes - bigger Escape key. Happy Vimmer.</li><li>Bigger Power button, smaller ThinkVantage button.</li><li>Much larger touchpad with macintosh-like "hidden" buttons. Even when I exclusively use trackpoint, it is very nice.</li><li>Quite silent fan under load, feels better.</li><li>Very fast BIOS, dunno what kind of technology is this, but few seconds saved everyday.</li><li>VGA and Display Port on the left side. At last!</li><li>Yeah, it has some faster components inside. And yeah, I dont really see any difference.</li></ul><br /><b>Cons</b><br /><br /><ul><li>Display is not bad, but I was expecting a bit more from 12.5" IPS LED (1366x768). Standard angles.</li><li>I dont like bigger Delete key since Insert was moved to the left. Can live with it.</li><li>Power cord plug on the back side. I like it on the left more. Not a blocker.</li><li>Ethernet plug on the right side. Guys, most people are right-handed and ethernet cables are hard. Dont like it on this side.</li><li>USB ports swapped (two on the left and one on the right now).</li><li>Mic port is gone. Probably combined into the headphones. I am not sure how to connect my headphones and mic there.</li><li>Damn, incompatible UltraBay dock again! It has one more USB port, but this really sucks. Money, money, money...</li></ul>
