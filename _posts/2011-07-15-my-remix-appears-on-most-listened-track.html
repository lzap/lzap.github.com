<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
I am happy to do one exciting announcement today. I just found out remix of my track <b>On The Moon</b> called <b>Walz Into The Moonlight</b> is featured on the <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/albums?order=listened_desc&tag_idstr=&location_country=all">most listened</a> album on Jamendo across all coutries and <i>all the time</i> (as of July 2011). It's called <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/3661">Listen</a> (track no 12). I released the original track on <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/disharmonic/2958">ccMixter</a> in 2005, site for sharing audio content licensed under Creative Commons.<br /><br /><b>This is cool</b>. This is real power of Creative Commons license!<br /><br />Now, I have prepared special EP release featuring both tracks and I gave it name <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/94802">Walz On The Moon</a>. The remix was done by chillout guru <a href="http://www.tryad.org/">Tryad</a> in December, 2006. As you can hear he kept the original mood, the piano line and also most of the original arrangement. His remix is a bit slower though. I tend to like it maybe more than my original one.<br /><br />You can buy/support the album on Jamendo.com, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Tryad/dp/B000H2NH4M">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/listen/id170518844">iTunes</a> and many other on-line music stores. If you wan't the money in my pocket, buy <b>Walz On The Moon EP</b> from the link above ;-)<br /><br />What you think? <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/94802/writereview">Write a review</a> for me on the Jamendo or drop me a line here!
