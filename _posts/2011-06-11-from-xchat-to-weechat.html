I am using <a href="http://www.weechat.org/">weechat</a> now for all my IRC communication. With <a href="http://www.bitlbee.org/">BitlBee</a> server I am also proxying my Jabber, Twitter and Facebook communication to my weechat. Everything in one place and over ssh.<br /><br />Weechat is awesome. I like it for its split screen feature, very nice default shortcuts and flexible configuration. To start with it I highly recommend its <a href="http://www.weechat.org/doc/">quick start guide</a> and the user's guide then.<br /><br />The most important keys are ALT+A (last activity cycle) and F5-F8 (window/buffer switches). There are many configuration options. I would suggest the "weechat.look.buffer_notify_default" setting to message not to flood your activity list and "/buffer notify highlight" on "talky" channels.<br /><br />There are also many plugins from which I suggest notification and url plugins. The latter are shortening URLs which is very handy when you split vertically. My favourite aliases are:<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">ww => /away -all $1; /nick -all lzap-$1</span><br /><br />When I go away, e.g. /ww lunch<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">bb => /away -all; /nick -all lzap</span><br /><br />When I am back.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">gkk => /query -server fn #katello</span><br /><br />Go to katello channel on the freenode server. Etc.<br /><br />Apart from internal IRC servers within our company you can reach me on FreeNode channels #katello, #pulp, #candlepin and #theforeman (nick "lzap"). I am idling on Jabber (both jabber.cz and google.com) and Facebook chat (lukas.zapletal) as well.<br /><br />Weechat rocks.
