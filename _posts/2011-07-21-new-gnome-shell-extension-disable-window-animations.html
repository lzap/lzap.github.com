<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
I have created new Gnome Shell extension called <a href="https://github.com/lzap/disable-window-animations">disable-window-animations</a>. It's very simple. It disables all window manager animations like Window "slide-ins", Workspace "slide-ups" and "slide-downs" and many more... :-)<br /><br />However it does NOT disable dash animations (Window-key "zoom-ins" and "zoom-outs" etc.)<br /><br />I change workspaces very often and it was driving me crazy. There was no way of disabling it. Monkey patch did help here. Enjoy.
