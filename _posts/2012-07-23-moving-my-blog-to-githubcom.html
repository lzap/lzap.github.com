<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
Guys, I am going to move my blog to github.com infrastructure. I will be using Jekyll templating framework, pages will be pregenerated with Twitter Bootstrap. Migration from Blogger.com was pretty straightforward, I will blog about it later on.<br /><br />Nothing is gonna change for you, even URLs will remain the same, but please check if you have subscribed the correct RSS address. The correct one is:<br /><br />http://feeds.feedburner.com/LukasZapletal<br /><br />Wrong one is:<br /><br />http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/feeds/posts/default<br /><br />This is because blogger.com does not allow to change it in the HTML META header. If you are not sure, just unsubscribe and re-subscribe using my Feedburner button or <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LukasZapletal">this link</a>. The feedburner will automatically switch over to the new blog.<br /><br />Reasons? I find blogger.com pretty slow here and editing technical articles is too painful. The editor sucks, no improvements for almost 2 years. And blogger.com goes down way too often.<br /><br />Advantages? Blazing fast speed thank to Rackspace hosting and pregenerated files. You will feel it mainly in Europe. Mardown syntax is cool too. And also much better editing using Vim. :-)
