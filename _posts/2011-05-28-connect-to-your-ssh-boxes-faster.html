If you want ultra-fast connection login times to your ssh servers you may like to change several values in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file along with RSA authentication:<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">GSSAPIAuthentication no<br />UseDNS no</span><br /><br />You can use this only if you don't need GSS or reverse DNS of course. No more delays. Every milisecond counts!
