<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
If they told you your favourite audio player is lightweight, they lied to you. <a href="http://decibel.silent-blade.org/">Decibel Audio Player</a> is the one that does the right thing. It can play. You can browse directories. It can shuffle tracks and show album cover. It's written in Python. Did I wrote <b>it can play</b>?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t8-KuTLsNy0/T-ltMAMuyzI/AAAAAAAAAf4/ivQxxURcb1w/s1600/dap108.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t8-KuTLsNy0/T-ltMAMuyzI/AAAAAAAAAf4/ivQxxURcb1w/s400/dap108.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />No SQLite, no MySQL, no NoSQL. Although there is a possibility to build a database via simple plug-in, the main workflow are, belive me or not, files and directories. And lzap loves that. Yay, lzap wants that!<br /><br />This package was orphaned for some time in Fedora, but I made it back into Fedora 17 (FEDORA-2012-8412). Enjoy this awesome audio player once again.
