Heya, you may already noticed the new site <a href="http://extensions.gnome.org/">extensions.gnome.org</a> for Gnome Shell extensions. It is possible to install extensions with a single mouse click with the latest and greatest version.<br /><br />I just put my <a href="https://github.com/lzap/disable-window-animations">Disable Window Animations</a> extensions there, so you can easily install from the service.<br /><br />It is available here: <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/119/disable-window-animations/">https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/119/disable-window-animations/</a><br /><br />Enjoy and HNY!
