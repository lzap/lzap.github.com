My mum bought a mowing machine few ears ago in Mountfield stores and they gave her Acer Aspire One netbook. Yeah for free - special action. But this is extraordinary piece of junk hardware - Atom CPU, 1 GB RAM, 1024Ã—600 LCD screen and internal 16 GB compact flash card. All with preloaded Windows XP that can get you to the internet as fast as 8-9 minutes. Everything is hell slow, system has few minutes lags sometimes.<br /><br />This is really not working. Mom gave it to my young cousin. He found soon it is not possible to use it. I installed him Linux on a external USB drive, he just needed something to browse the web and store some pictures.<br /><br />Today he had some problem with keyboard, so I took this piece back for repairs. As he told me he is not using Windows XP on the internal "drive" anymore, I was thinking about putting some read-only Linux in there. The flash card is very slow because of writes, not reads. What an idea.<br /><br />I hit <a href="http://www.android-x86.org/">Android x86</a> project, they are offering builds of Android for Intel CPUs. I gave it a try and - belive me or not - it's pretty usable hardware now! Boots about 40 seconds, yeah, but then it works like a charm. Ethernet, WiFi, touchpad, keyboard and mouse - all is working.<br /><br />Update: It sucks :-) Once you install official Google Android Market, you find out applications crashing. I tried MeeGo and it was much better. But I did not like it. Then I also tried Chromium OS. And it is very nice! Very fast boot, nice experience. The only problem is Chrome browser :-) It writes to the disc so much it is practically unusable. Only anonymous/guest mode works fine.<br /><br />I guess I will put a read-only Linux there (Puppy or DSL).
