<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
From time to time, I have been cleaning all merged branches using <i>git branch -d</i> command. I was wondering if I can do this automatically. Guess what. I can do that and it's as easy as:<br /><br /><i>git branch --merged master | grep -v 'master$' | xargs git branch -d</i><br /><br />Adding to <a href="http://lukas.zapletalovi.com/2011/04/my-git-aliases.html">my git aliases</a> right away!
