Hey all, I am happy to publish my talk I have yesterday on [Developer
Conference 2013 in Brno](http://www.devconf.cz). Slides are available on-line
[in html
format](http://lzap.fedorapeople.org/presentations/katello-on-torquebox/).

And also as PDF on the SlideShare.net:

I was talking about proof of concept port of Katello to JRuby. I had several
issues with rubygem slow loading, bundler and rvm. The actual port was pretty
smooth and I was giving several tips for JRuby porting, in particular for Ruby
on Rails applications. At the end of the talk, I did short introduction to
SystemTap and it's integration with Ruby as well as bundler_ext extension.

The session was recorded, expect the video to be published hopefully soon.
