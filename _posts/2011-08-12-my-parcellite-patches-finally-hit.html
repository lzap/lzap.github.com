<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
It took some time to the parcellite upstream author to release new version (1.0.2 rc3) with my trim-whitespace patches. But its finally there. Today I <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=730240">updated rawhide RPM package</a> and submitted it to the package maintainer. It wont hit Fedora 16 because it's too late, will eventually appear in Fedora 17.<br /><br />If you can't wait for new features <a href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=3267872">I prepared</a> Fedora 15 packages (both 32 and 64 bits). You can download them from my <a href="http://lzap.fedorapeople.org/fedora-packaging/parcellite/1.0.2-0.1.rc3/">fedorapeople.org site</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://parcellite.sourceforge.net/">Parcellite</a> is a lightweight GTK+ clipboard manager. It is a stripped down, basic-features-only clipboard manager with a small memory footprint for those who like simplicity.<br /><br />Enjoy!
