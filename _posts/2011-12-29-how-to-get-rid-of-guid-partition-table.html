<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
I made a default installation of Fedora 16 on my testing machine the other day and Anaconda has installed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table">GPT</a> on the hard drive. Now, I want to fall back to MBR. Wildly used tool fdisk was showing a message&nbsp;<i>Warning!! Unsupported GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected. Use GNU Parted</i>. Frankly, I did not like it at all.<br /><br />My first idea was to get rid of the first few sectors on the hard drive:<br /><br /><i>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1</i><br /><br />Guess what, it did not work. After some time spend on the internet I found out GPT has a "backup" entry at the very end of the disc. I tried to copy zeroes over it, but it did not work too. The trick&nbsp;is quite easy, but it was more difficult to google this time:<br /><br /><br /><i>parted /dev/sda</i><br /><i>mklabel msdos</i><br /><i>quit</i><br /><br />Finally, the disc is back to traditional MBR. I think I don't like new things, sometimes.<br />
