<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
Packages for <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/15">Fedora 15</a> are emerging tomorrow. There's <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Branch_Freeze_Policy">Branch Freeze</a> event showing the "face" of the next Fedora version.<br /><br />At the Branch Freeze event, all packages are branched from master in source control. This is to allow the branched tree to stabilize and enter a bug-fix and polish phase of development. Builds from the branch that are deemed stable will be published into their own repo on the mirrors beside rawhide. <br /><br />There was higher package git activity this weekend. Fedora 15 will likely feature Rails 3 for example. And <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/pkgs-best-fedora-rawhide">many more</a>! I am coming with a longer list next week. Stay tuned!
