<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
Few weekends ago, I've updated my Gnome Shell plugin <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/119/disable-window-animations/">Disable Window Animations</a> for Fedora 17 (Gnome Shell 3.4). If you switch workspaces often, you might find this handy. I switch them thousands time a day, this saves me time & eyes. Like it? Say thanks in the comments.<br /><br />This extension simply disable all window manager animations: window "slide-ins" and workspace "slide-ups" and "slide-downs". However, it does not disable dash animations ("zoom-ins" and <br />"zoom-outs" etc.) because I don't find them annoying. For more info you can visit my <a href="https://github.com/lzap/disable-window-animations">github.com</a> homepage.
