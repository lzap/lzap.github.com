<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
We are announcing the opening of the <a href="http://www.katello.org">Katello</a> project. Katello is an open source system management platform and will be the upstream project for Red Hat System Engine, a component of the larger CloudForms product. System Engine is the subscription, content, and configuration engine for CloudForms. It will focus on a system's lifecycle similar to what the RHN Satellite product does today.<br /><br />Katello is designed as an orchestration layer over best-of-breed projects: <a href="http://www.pulpproject.org">Pulp</a> for Content Management,  <a href="http://www.theforeman.org">Foreman</a> for Configuration Management, and <a href="http://www.candlepinproject.org">Candlepin</a> for Susbcription Management.
