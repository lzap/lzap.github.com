I need to get everything running on one physical box using libvirt. I had to do three rounds until I finally configured everything correctly (actually doing my third round now). Anyway, let me share one libvirt-related idea that came to my mind today.</description></item><item><title>Copy-on-write with KVM</title><link>https://blog.zapletalovi.com/posts/2011-08-28-copy-on-write-with-kvm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.zapletalovi.com/posts/2011-08-28-copy-on-write-with-kvm/</guid><description>While KVM/QEMU snapshoting is still a dirty feature (quite slow), I love copy-on-write disc image format of the QEMU. It is actually the best way how to quiclky provision pre-installed systems for testing and development. The idea is easy:
Install a base operating system, configure it for your specific purposes.Stop it. You wont use it anymore, only copy-on-write "children". You may start it to do some additional configuration when you forgot something for example.</description></item></channel></rss>
