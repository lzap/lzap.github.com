It has a different concept and some administrators can be confused. I highly recommend to read RHEL 6 Storage Administration Guide or other documents related to NFSv4.
The key change in NFSv4 is the concept of the root directory. To get things working for both v4 and v3 clients the most recommended way is to remount everything under one directory (we will create /exports for that).</description></item></channel></rss>
