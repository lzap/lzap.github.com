It has many features for developers, but it has quite poor external command execution. While it is possible to run external programs in xterm (or using start.exe on Windows) it would be nice to have integrated terminal for running external programs (Python, Perl, Ruby scripts, compilation scripts etc).Vide&amp;nbsp;is very simple terminal that waits on DBUS. User is able to send commands (using&amp;nbsp;videx&amp;nbsp;command) to named tabs, like executing compilation scripts, programs or even debug things in the CLI.</description></item></channel></rss>
