I use Czech keyboard layout for most of my career even for programming. These combinations are different on MacOS. I am able to probably learn back to US keyboard layout, as I was using it previously and it should not be a problem.</description></item><item><title>Remap US key next to enter to enter in MacOS</title><link>http://blog.zapletalovi.com/posts/2021-04-19-remap-us-key-next-to-enter-to-enter-in-macos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.zapletalovi.com/posts/2021-04-19-remap-us-key-next-to-enter-to-enter-in-macos/</guid><description>The Czech keyboard layout on a physical US Mac keyboard has some keys which are pretty much useless. For example the key | aka \ next to the enter is actually also available on tilde key next to left shift in Czech layout and since I am used to wide enter key I end up pressing it when I want to hit enter. It renders to a weird &amp;ldquo;double tilde&amp;rdquo; character which I never use anyway.</description></item></channel></rss>
