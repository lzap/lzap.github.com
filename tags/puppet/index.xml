We have found that puppet master was running unconfined, therefore the Puppet SELinux policy was not effective in Fedoras.
The puppet package update fixes one little issue (missing runtime dependency) and corrects startup wrappers for systemd which puts Puppet Master into correct SELinux domain puppetmaster_t. Since this has low security impact, we have decided to backport this change into Fedora 20 too.</description></item></channel></rss>
