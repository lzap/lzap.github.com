title: About me
---

I am a software engineer who works for Red Hat. Currently, I am in the Insights
team, working on projects for the RHEL Image Builder product that involve
[osbuild](https://www.osbuild.org).

In the past, I contributed to provisioning tools (covering bare-metal, PXE/UEFI
HTTP, virtualization, and cloud environments), specifically to the Red Hat
Satellite product and Foreman projects. I am also involved in the security and
performance aspects of the projects and products I co-maintain.

My internet nick is typically `lzap`, that's el-zet-ej-pi.

I live and work in Velký Týnec, Olomoucký kraj,
[Czechia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic), Europe.
