title: About me
---

I am a software engineer who works for Red Hat. My primary interest is in Linux
server management software development with focus on provisioning, PXE/HTTP
UEFI booting, hardware discovery and networking. I am also involved in security
and performance aspects of the projects and products I co-maintain.

My internet nick is typically `lzap`, that's el-zet-ej-pi.

I live and work in Velký Týnec, Olomoucký kraj,
[Czechia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic), Europe.
