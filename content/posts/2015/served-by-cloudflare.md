title: Served by CloudFlare
---

Starting today, my blog is being served through CloudFlare caching CDN. This
means faster loading speeds, but what's more important is valid SSL
certificate through their SSL Free Termination service. I will switch all
links to https by default and after few weeks if there are no issues reported,
I will force HTTPS via redirect.

And yeah, my blog now supports HTTP/2 and SPDY and other fancy things.

Please report issues via discussion or IRC or Google+. Take care!
