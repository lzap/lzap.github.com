title: Dropping Feedburner   update RSS ATOM URL
---

Hey, I am dropping Google Feedburner, please [update the URL](https://lukas.zapletalovi.com/atom.xml) of the feed if you are reading this in your RSS. The new URL is:

    https://lukas.zapletalovi.com/atom.xml

The old URL will continue work, but after Google acquired Feedburner the service did not see much development and features are being rather removed. Migrate today if you want to keep reading those random Linux + FOSS + devops notes of mine.
