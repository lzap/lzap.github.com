title: Gpaste terminal integration
---

Sometimes I need to copy whole output of some program into my clipboard or selection. I use nice Gnome Shell extension called Gpaste (packages gpaste and gnome-shell-extension-gpaste in Fedora and Red Hats). It is a nice daemon, command line tool and Gnome Shell menu, everything well integrated.<br /><br />And how to do that? It is easy. Just pipe it through the gpaste command, I am not kidding.<br /><br /><i>$ echo "Some very long output" | gpaste</i><br /><br />The long test is now in your selection or clipboard (according to your gpaste configuration). That's it :-)
