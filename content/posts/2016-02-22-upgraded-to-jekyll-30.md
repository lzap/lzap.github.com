title: Upgraded to Jekyll 3.0
---

Github Pages now supports Jekyll 3.0 which has some backward incompatible
features, so I have decided to upgrade. I was quite surprised when I realized
I am still using Jekyll 1.0 and everything was working great so far!

What's great about static pages is *you* decide when you upgrade your site.
There are no security updates, it's just bunch HTML and CSS. Upgrade was
smooth, I only had to do two configuration changes and one layout change.
Looks like Github and CloudFlare is a great combo, thanks folks!

I would like to thank Adam PÅ™ibyl for his missing dates report. All posts now
contain date and list of relevant tags in the bottom-right corner. If you miss
anything, let me know via e-mail or Google Plus comments (do they even work?
:-)

News? We are wrapping up Foreman 1.11 release and I bought small little Intel
NUC box to do me network management (DHCP/DNS/Foreman) in the house. Well, it
will likely provide also Kodi and Steam streaming if I decide to put it under
my telly. So far, I am impressed (6 W idle).
