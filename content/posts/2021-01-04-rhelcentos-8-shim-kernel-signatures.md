title: RHEL/CentOS 8 shim kernel signatures
---

Due to hardening within the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 kernel, which was
released as part of the
[CVE-2020-10713](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10713) update,
previous Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 kernel versions have not been added to
shimâ€™s allow list. If you are running with Secure Boot enabled, and the user
needs to boot to an older kernel version, its hash must be manually enrolled
into the trust list. This is achieved by executing the following commands:

    # pesign -P -h -i /boot/vmlinuz-<version>
    # mokutil --import-hash <hash value returned from pesign>
    # reboot

This can be problem when PXE or UEFI HTTP booting older kickstart trees via
grub2 bootloader which comes from newer version of RHEL or CentOS, for example
when using Foreman, Katello, Orachino or Red Hat Satellite.

## Hashes

    CentOS-8.0.1905 386dd5097c3306c8d55a173b5809b5dc7440d973762d69d59c9698b06449513a

## Example

To import CentOS 8.0 kernel signature to a target host (a server that needs to
be provisioned), boot it in SecureBoot EFI mode and do:

    mokutil --import-hash 386dd5097c3306c8d55a173b5809b5dc7440d973762d69d59c9698b06449513a
