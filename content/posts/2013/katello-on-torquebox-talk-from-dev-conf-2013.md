Hey all, I am happy to publish my talk I have yesterday on [Developer

I was talking about proof of concept port of Katello to JRuby. I had several
issues with rubygem slow loading, bundler and rvm. The actual port was pretty
smooth and I was giving several tips for JRuby porting, in particular for Ruby
on Rails applications. At the end of the talk, I did short introduction to
SystemTap and it's integration with Ruby as well as bundler_ext extension.

The session was recorded, expect the video to be published hopefully soon.
