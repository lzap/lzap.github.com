title: Git in Practice slides
---

This morning, I have talk about Git at the Palacky University in Olomouc. Here
are slides I promised to put on my blog.

Honestly, it is not possible to give decent git overview in one hour. It was
just a master plan I could not achieve. I tried at least.


Do not forget, the book you want to go for is [Pro
Git](http://git-scm.com/book). Available in Czech as, believe me or not, [Pro
Git](http://knihy.nic.cz).

Here you go:
